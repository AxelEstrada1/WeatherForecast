# WeatherForecast

On this assignment, we used api to be able to create a weather forecast website.
Doing so, we are able to put in different cities and with the api, we can pull the different information of each city that has been input on the search bar.
With help of the api, we can display the information to the user at the bottom of the screen.
When the user searches different cities, the previous cities are saved and stored to be able to keep track of what cities have been looked up already.
